  To add this component to your library, refer to your Delphi manual
"User's Guide" on page 69. The two main files for this component are
TJoystk.dcr and TJoystk.pas.
  If you install many components, you would be advised to put them
in a 'common' subdirectory. That way, whenever you ReBuild the
Library, the Delphi Librarian only has one directory to look under.
